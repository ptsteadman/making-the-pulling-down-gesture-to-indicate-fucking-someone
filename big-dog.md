# Big Dog

Waking up in the Ryans' home was a strange and almost magical experience for
Lisa.  Her body felt relaxed and light, almost childlike.  A blue winter sky had
warmed the clean wooden floor of the guest bedroom, inviting her to get out of
bed.  

The Ryans were practicing architects, working at a firm they had founded in the
80's.  Dr. Ryan also taught at the College of Fine Arts, and was Lisa's faculty
advisor.  Dr. Ryan knew Lisa well enough to know that she would jump at the
chance to spent winter break at the Ryans' home dogsitting  while they were on a
trip to Cuba. 

Lisa didn't want to go home for Christmas, and in fact had sworn a year ago that
she would find some acceptable reason to avoid the family Christmas routine.
