# Big Dog

Waking up in the Ryans' home was a strange and almost magical experience.  It
made Lisa realize how ugly and uncomfortable her experience at school was, how
broken down she was.  When she awoke around 9AM, her body felt relaxed and
light, almost childlike.  A blue winter sky had warmed the clean wooden floor of
the guest bedroom, inviting her to get out of bed.  

The Ryans were both practicing architects, working at a firm they had founded
together in the 80's.  Dr. Ryan also taught at the College of Fine Arts, and was
Lisa's faculty advisor After meeting about Lisa's graduation requirements, Dr.
Ryan had asked if she was willing to help dogsit during spring break.  The Ryans
were going on a trip to Cuba.

Lisa had arrived at the house late the night before, right before the Ryans left for
the airport.  


The Ryans' home was She'd be there until the Ryans got back from Cuba,
their spring break trip.
