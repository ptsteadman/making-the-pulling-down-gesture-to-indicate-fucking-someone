The Ryans were practicing architects, working at a firm they had founded in the
80's.  Dr. Ryan also taught at the College of Fine Arts, and was Lisa's faculty
advisor.

Lisa didn't want to go home for Christmas, and in fact had sworn a year ago that
she would find some acceptable reason to avoid the family Christmas routine.

Iris was friends with Charles. "Charles is saying we should visit you there,"
said Iris.


What is friendship
Shame and loneliness

Alex spoke to P.P. Hero in the kitchen of his home, at an event for the Rotary
youth exchange students of the district.

"You have so many DVDs," said Alex. "How do you say 'DVD' in Mandarin?"

Hero shrugged. "DVD," he said.

Alex noticed all six seasons of "Megastructures", set behind a glass case
reaching up to the the second story of his living room, along with many other
educational documentaries.

The living room was presently full of teenagers from the industrial nations of
the world, mostly Brazil, Japan, Mexico, the United States, Germany, and France.
They sat in small groups around portable hotpots set up on rolling carts,
dipping squid, cabbage and tofu into the boiling red water.

"How many of them have you watched?"

"Most," said Hero, smiling and opening his fridge. "I make time to relax and
learn."

Hero studied the inside of the fridge, his expressive face clearly indicating
that he'd forgotten what he was looking for.

"Ah, so," he said, selecting a taro root. "Would you like to try?" he said,
offering some to Alex.

"No thanks." Hero began to cut the root.

Alex nodded and returned to the living room, joining a group of Mexican
students.

"Let's take a picture," said Emilio, gesturing towards the windows overlooking
Taipei.

"Mr. Hero, you have a beautiful house, a really sexy house," yelled Emilio as
Alex found a spot among the Mexicans and prepared to smile.

It was the most beautiful place Alex had ever been, he thought. It was like
being inside of the bright jewelry cases in the mall, but it was cool and wet at
the same time. The dark stone underlying the hills of Yangmingshan
formed the back of the living room, with a faint smell of sulphur. Emilio took
the picture. The group crowded around Emilio's camera.

"Oh no, lets do another," said Emilio. "Your nose, looks like a boner on your
face."

He missed so much: late for the New Year's trip to South Taiwan. He had
wandered around Taipei train station for hours.




Alex didn't want to seem desperate, lonely in this beautiful house.

Alex tried to use some of the Ryan's fancy ingredients. The pasta ended up being
too salty. The pot lay unwashed in the soapstone sink until he realized that
Daisy would happily lick it clean.

Alex sat in a leather chair under a lamp with a long metal neck. He felt
accomplished.
