# Networked Individualism

The Ryans were practicing architects, working at a firm they had founded in the
80's.  Dr. Ryan also taught at the College of Fine Arts, and was Lisa's faculty
advisor.

Lisa didn't want to go home for Christmas, and in fact had sworn a year ago that
she would find some acceptable reason to avoid the family Christmas routine.

Iris was friends with Charles. "Charles is saying we should visit you there,"
said Iris.

Lisa didn't want to seem desperate, lonely in this beautiful house.

What is friendship
Shame and loneliness

Lisa tried to use some of the Ryan's fancy ingredients. The pasta ended up being
too salty. The pot lay unwashed in the soapstone sink until she realized that
Daisy would happily lick it clean.

Lisa sat in a leather chair under a lamp with a long metal neck. She felt
accomplished.

Alex spoke to P.P. Hero in the kitchen of his home, at an event for the Rotary
youth exchange students of the district.

"You have so many DVDs," said Alex. "How do you say 'DVD' in Mandarin?"

Hero shrugged. "DVD," he said.

Many of the DVDs were educational documentaries. Alex noticed all six seasons of
"Megastructures", set behind a glass case reaching up to the the second story of
his living room.

The living room was presently full of teenagers from the industrial nations of
the world, mostly Brazil, Japan, Mexico, the United States, Germany, and France.

"How many of them have you watched?"

"Most," said Hero, smiling and opening his fridge.

"How do you find the time?"

"If you're careful, you will have lots of time."


"You will continue like this until it costs you too much. Then you will have to
change."
