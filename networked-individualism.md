Alex spoke with P.P. Hero in the kitchen of his home, at an event for the
exchange students of the district.

"You have so many DVDs," said Alex. "How do you say 'DVD' in Mandarin?"

Hero shrugged. "DVD," he said.

Alex had noticed all six seasons of "Megastructures" set behind a glass case in
his living room.

The living room was full of teenagers from the industrial nations of the world,
mostly Brazil, Japan, Mexico, the United States, Germany, and France.  The
students were in small groups around portable hotpots set up on rolling carts,
dipping squid, cabbage and tofu into the boiling red water.

"How many have you watched?"

"Most," said Hero, smiling and opening his fridge. "I make time to relax and
learn."

Hero studied the inside of the fridge, his expressive face clearly indicating
that he'd forgotten what he was looking for.

"Ah, so," he said, selecting a taro root. He cut it up on the jet black counter
and then swept the slices into his hand.

"I'll introduce you to my dog," said Hero.

Alex followed Hero into a room off of the kitchen, and pointed into a dark cave.

"Here she is."

A yellow lab wagged its tail at Hero and Alex. Hero kneeled on a pillow besides
the dog's bed and let the dog eat the taro out of his hand.

"What's her name?"

"Daisy," said Hero.

After a period of silence, Alex excused himself and returned to the living room.
As soon as he entered, Emilio draped his arm over his shoulder.

"Let's take a picture," said Emilio, gesturing towards the windows overlooking
Taipei.

"Mr. Hero, you have a beautiful house, a really sexy house," yelled Emilio as
Alex found a spot among the Mexicans and prepared to smile.

Hero's home was like a jewelry case, but cool and wet, smelling slightly of
sulphur, from the dark stone underlying the hills of Yangmingshan.

Emilio took the picture. The group crowded around Emilio's camera.

"Oh no, lets do another," said Emilio.  He turned to Alex.

"Your nose, it looks like a boner on your face."

While Alex was waiting for the next episode of Gossip Girl to buffer, he noticed
that his mom was online. He pressed the call button on Skype. The sound of the
ringtone was desolate but he appreciated that he was finally reaching back to
his family. He hadn't called in over a month.

"Hi Alex! How's it going?" his mother said. Alex could tell she was in the
kitchen doing something.

"Really good," he said. His voice didn't work at first.

"It's late there, after midnight right?"

"Yeah, I'm working on my college essays."

"How are they going?"

"Okay," said Alex. "I'll have some more time during the Mid-Autumn festival."

His mother asked questions about his host family, the neighborhood where he was
living, his school, and the other exchange students. Alex tried to think up
questions to ask about his brothers, but it was hard.

"Just get the essays done, Alex!" said his mother as they ended the call, after
thirty two minutes. It was two AM.

In the episode of Gossip Girl, Serena kissed Adam fast and improbably, in the
vaulted entrance to a tower. Beautiful. Alex hoped against hope that it would
happen to him somehow. It would be so terrible if it didn't, he didn't know how
he could live.



Bad Romance

He missed so much: late for the New Year's trip to South Taiwan. He had
wandered around Taipei train station for hours.

"P.P. Sunshine asked that I meet with you," said Hero.

"Yes, I understand," said Alex.




Alex didn't want to seem desperate, lonely in this beautiful house.

Alex tried to use some of the Ryan's fancy ingredients. The pasta ended up being
too salty. The pot lay unwashed in the soapstone sink until he realized that
Daisy would happily lick it clean.

Alex sat in a leather chair under a lamp with a long metal neck. He felt
accomplished.
