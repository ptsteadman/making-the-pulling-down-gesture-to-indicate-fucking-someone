# Networked Individualism

In the hours before Lisa awoke, the blue winter sky warmed the wooden floor of
the guest bedroom, inviting her to get out of bed.

The Ryans were practicing architects, working at a firm they had founded in the
80's.  Dr. Ryan also taught at the College of Fine Arts, and was Lisa's faculty
advisor.  Dr. Ryan knew Lisa well enough to know that she would jump at the
chance to spent winter break at the Ryans' home dogsitting  while they were on a
trip to Cuba. 

Lisa didn't want to go home for Christmas, and in fact had sworn a year ago that
she would find some acceptable reason to avoid the family Christmas routine.  

As the sun set on Thursday afternoon, Lisa tried to cook pasta while texting
Iris. She was wearing a bathrobe.

Iris was friends with Charles. "Charles is saying we should visit you there,"
said Iris.

Lisa was afraid that she and Iris didn't really know each other well enough yet,
for this.

Lisa didn't want to be judged, or seem desperate, lonely in this beautiful
house.

What is friendship
Shame and loneliness

Lisa tried to use some of the Ryan's fancy ingredients. The pasta ended up being
too salty. The pot lay unwashed in the soapstone sink until she realized that
Daisy would happily lick it clean.

Lisa sat in a leather chair under a lamp with a long metal neck. She felt
accomplished.

"Liv -- yeah -- nice to meet you -- you're from Instagram right?"
