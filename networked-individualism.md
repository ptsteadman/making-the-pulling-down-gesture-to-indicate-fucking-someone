Alex spoke with P.P. Hero in the kitchen of his home, at an event for the
exchange students of the district.

"You have so many DVDs," said Alex. "How do you say 'DVD' in Mandarin?"

Hero shrugged. "DVD," he said.

Alex had noticed all six seasons of "Megastructures" behind a glass case in
his living room.

The living room was full of teenagers from the industrial nations of the world,
sitting in small groups around portable hotpots, dipping squid, cabbage and tofu
into the boiling red water.

"How many have you watched?"

"Most," said Hero, smiling and opening his fridge. "I make time to relax and
learn."

Hero studied the inside of the fridge, his expressive face clearly indicating
that he'd forgotten what he was looking for.

"Ah, so," he said, selecting a taro root. He cut it up on the jet black counter
and then swept the slices into his hand.

"I'll introduce you to my dog," said Hero.

Alex followed Hero into a dark room off of the kitchen.

"Here she is."

A yellow lab wagged its tail at Hero and Alex. Hero kneeled on a pillow besides
the dog's bed and let the dog eat the taro out of his hand.

"What's her name?"

"Daisy," said Hero.

After a period of silence, Alex excused himself and returned to the living room.
As soon as he entered, Emilio draped his arm over his shoulder.

"Let's take a picture," said Emilio, gesturing towards the windows overlooking
Taipei.

"Mr. Hero, you have a beautiful house, a really sexy house," yelled Emilio.
Alex found a spot among the students and prepared to smile.

Hero's home was like a jewelry case, but cool and wet, smelling slightly of
sulphur, from the dark stone underlying the hills of Yangmingshan.

Emilio took the picture. The group crowded around Emilio's camera.

"Oh no, lets do another," said Emilio.  He turned to Alex.

"Your nose, it looks like a boner on your face."

Alex was lying in bed with his laptop, waiting for an episode of Gossip Girl to
buffer. He noticed that his mom was on Skype, and pressed the call button. The
sound of the ringtone was desolate but he appreciated that he was finally
reaching back to his family. He hadn't called in over a month.

"Hi Alex! How's it going?" his mother said. Alex could tell she was in the
kitchen doing something.

"Really good," he said. His voice didn't work at first.

"Just get the essays done, Alex!" said his mother as they ended the call, after
thirty two minutes. It was two AM.

In the episode of Gossip Girl, Serena kissed Adam fast and improbably, in the
vaulted entrance to a tower. Beautiful. Alex hoped that it would happen to him
soon. It would be so terrible if it didn't. He didn't know how he could live if
it didn't.

"P.P. Sunshine asked that I meet with you," said Hero.

"Yes, I understand," said Alex.

"There are issues with your lateness to school."

They were eating at a French-themed restaurant. Alex told Hero that his lateness
and other problems were caused by his college essays, and that it'd get better
once he finished. Hero didn't seem moved.

"That doesn't change the fact that your teacher feel disrespected," said Hero.

Alex was unable to understand the interactions between the Rotary members and
seemed mostly unconcerned

Hero slurped at his French onion soup. Alex felt annoyed with him. The first
time Alex heard Hero speak at the orientation event for the exchange students,
he knew Hero was special somehow. He'd felt shivers as Hero welcomed the
students to Taiwan and talked about their monthly allowance, because he knew
Hero was speaking from a place that addressed the experience of being young in a
strange new city.

"How do you say 'respect' in Mandarin?"
Alex talked about the programs that he wanted to get into.

It's language that they connect about.

Ashamed of his essay.

"What are you doing here? If there is no reason for you to be here, I recommend
that you go home."

"I don't have many projects currently."

He missed so much: late for the New Year's trip to South Taiwan. He had
wandered around Taipei train station for hours.


Alex didn't want to seem desperate, lonely in this beautiful house.

Alex tried to use some of the Ryan's fancy ingredients. The pasta ended up being
too salty. The pot lay unwashed in the soapstone sink until he realized that
Daisy would happily lick it clean.

Alex sat in a leather chair under a lamp with a long metal neck. He felt
accomplished.
