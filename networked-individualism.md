Alex spoke with P.P. Hero in the kitchen of his home, at an event for the
exchange students of the district.

"You have so many DVDs," said Alex. "How do you say 'DVD' in Mandarin?"

Hero shrugged. "DVD," he said.

Alex had noticed all six seasons of "Megastructures" set behind a glass case in
his living room.

The living room was presently full of teenagers from the industrial nations of
the world, mostly Brazil, Japan, Mexico, the United States, Germany, and France.
The students were in small groups around portable hotpots set up on rolling
carts, dipping squid, cabbage and tofu into the boiling red water.

"How many have you watched?"

"Most," said Hero, smiling and opening his fridge. "I make time to relax and
learn."

Hero studied the inside of the fridge, his expressive face clearly indicating
that he'd forgotten what he was looking for.

"Ah, so," he said, selecting a taro root. He cut it directly on the jet black
counter and then swept the slices into his hand.

"I'll introduce you to my dog," said Hero.

Alex followed Hero through a crowd of older Rotary members into a room off the
kitchen, and pointed into a dark cave.

"Here she is."

A yellow lab wagged its tail at Hero and Alex. Hero kneeled on a pillow besides
the dog's bed and let the dog eat the taro out of his hand.

"What's her name?"

"Daisy," said Hero.

After a period of silence, Alex excused himself and returned to the living room.
As soon as he entered, Emilio draped his arm over his shoulder.

"Let's take a picture," said Emilio, gesturing towards the windows overlooking
Taipei.

"Mr. Hero, you have a beautiful house, a really sexy house," yelled Emilio as
Alex found a spot among the Mexicans and prepared to smile.

Hero's home was like a jewelry case, but cool and wet, smelling slightly of
sulphur, from the dark stone underlying the hills of Yangmingshan.

Emilio took the picture. The group crowded around Emilio's camera.

"Oh no, lets do another," said Emilio.  He turned to Alex.

"Your nose, it looks like a boner on your face."

He missed so much: late for the New Year's trip to South Taiwan. He had
wandered around Taipei train station for hours.




Alex didn't want to seem desperate, lonely in this beautiful house.

Alex tried to use some of the Ryan's fancy ingredients. The pasta ended up being
too salty. The pot lay unwashed in the soapstone sink until he realized that
Daisy would happily lick it clean.

Alex sat in a leather chair under a lamp with a long metal neck. He felt
accomplished.
