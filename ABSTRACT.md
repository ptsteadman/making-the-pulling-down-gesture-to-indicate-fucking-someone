# Abstract of 'The Perfect Story', v0.2.0

A young person is dog-sitting for an older couple.  The older couple is on
vacation someplace remote, and the young person is staying with the dog in a
home located some distance from the center of a major city.  The young person,
who is relatively naive, enjoys the home and the city.  

But at some point, the dog dies, through no fault of the young person.  The
young person calls the older couple with the sad news, and insists that they not
cut their vacation short.  The older couple gives the young person the address
of a vet where the dog can be cremated.  The young person places the dog inside
of a large suitcase, and uses public transportation to bring the dog to the
vet's office.  When someone offers to help with the cumbersome suitcase, the
young person hands it over, and the stranger runs away with it.
