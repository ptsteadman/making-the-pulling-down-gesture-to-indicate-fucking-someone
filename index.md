The other exchange students didn't appreciate P.P. Hero's large collection of
educational DVDs, displayed on shelves rising behind his living room staircase.
Brent made his way up the warm, carpeted steps, looking at the titles on the
jewel cases. He was trying to look thoughtful. Below, the other exchange
students were making exaggerated conversation around boiling red hot pots with
squid and cabbage.

At the top of the stairs Brent entered the kitchen, nodding politely at a group
of older Rotarians standing uncomfortably in a beam of late afternoon sunlight.

Hero was washing a knife at the sink.

"You have so many DVDs," said Brent. "How do you say 'DVD' in Mandarin?"

Hero looked over at him and shrugged. "DVD," he said.

"How many of them have you watched?"

"Most," said Hero, opening his fridge. "I make time to relax and learn."

Hero studied the inside of the fridge, his face clearly showing that he'd
forgotten what he was looking for.

"Ah, so," he said, selecting a taro root. He cut it up on the jet black counter
and then swept the slices into his hand.

"I'll introduce you to my dog," said Hero.

Brent followed Hero into a dark laundry room adjacent to the kitchen.

"Here she is. Helsa."

A yellow lab wagged its tail quietly. Hero knelt down on a pillow besides the dog's
bed and let her eat the taro out of his hand.

"Your host mother asked me to meet with you," said Hero, a few weeks later.
Brent and Hero were eating at a French-themed restaurant on a quiet street south
of Zhongxiao East Road.

"There are issues with your lateness to school," said Hero. He lowered his head
and slurped his French Onion soup.

Brent wanted Hero to be different from the other Rotarians.

Brent explained that he was staying up late writing his college application
essays, that he was going to apply for a special scholarship. That's why he was
late.

"Stillll, your teachers and fellow students feel disrespected," said Hero.

"I'm sorry about that," said Brent.

Hero looked at Brent thoughtfully as the waiter poured a glass of wine.

"You are being very foolish, I think," said Hero finally. "Why are you here? In
Taiwan?"

Brent was suddenly very aware of his body, ashamed, staring at Hero's wine glass.

"I want to learn Mandarin," said Brent. He repeated himself clumsily in Mandarin.

"I'll help you," said Hero.

The tall blonde girl with the acne couldn't believe that Brent was a virgin. It
smelled like sulhpur and was raining. P.P. Power was leading a hiking trip
through the Yangmingshan hills. The softness of Brent's face after the sulphur
bath promised new, better skin.

The hike terminated at Hero's house.

Always with the smell of sulphur. I look forward to my skincare routine.  Brent
felt in Hero the desire to express something that wasn't part of the list of his
life, JSTOR

Brent watched as Hero .

"And you can start and stop the download whenever?"

"Yes."

Early in December, Hero invited Brent to a health club on the top floor of the
aquamarine Fuxing Sogo department store. Children were running around the
lobby, holding craft projects made of evergreen boughs and pasta.

The pool was surprisingly large and cold. After a short swim, Brent joined Hero
in the long, narrow steam room, empty except for two grey-haired men speaking
German.

Brent sat down next to Hero. He had a wet towel over his eyes.

"How do you feel about this building?" asked Hero.

"I feel it's strange," said Brent, in Mandarin. "I feel far away."

Hero used his face towel to wipe a circle on the tall window between them,
revealing the grey sky outside.

"I worked on this building in the early nineties."

"Wow."

Hero pointed out a sub-roof, still far above the streets below. "I designed the
horizontal beams over that gap, twelve stories high," said Hero, switching to
English. "They are wide enough to walk across."

"I see," said Brent.

---

Brent followed Hero out of the steam room. They entered a blue-tiled room of
baths, some cold and some hot.

Hero grabbed a pot of gritty soap and a sponge and pointed to a vaulted chamber.
He turned on a heavy flow of water with a faucet overhead.

"Here, I'll give you a scrub. Very good for your skin."

Brent stood, tense, under the lukewarm water as Hero scrubbed at his back and
neck.

Hero reached under Brent's swim trunks and grabbed his groin, his fingers
touching Brent's balls. Brent didn't move or say anything, thinking of pushing
Hero away, someone slipping. After about fifteen seconds Hero pulled his hand
out and gave Brent's legs a quick sponge.

"Now let's get in the cold water. Last step," said Hero.

Brent turned around and walked directly into the waist-deep pool, which was
shockingly cold. He sat down in it. There were a few other men.

Brent thought about cultural differences, wondering if he was interpreting the
moment correctly.

"Fresh water. Hard to find freshwater pool, with no chlorine," said Hero, in
English.

"After getting dressed, let's get hamburgers, okay?" continued Hero, in Mandarin
again.

"Sounds good," said Brent.

"You're learning a lot from Past President Hero," said Brent's host mother,
gesturing with a snail shell. "How to play chess, how to be a gentleman." She
punched Hero's arm. They were old friends.

Hero and Brent's host mother often brought Brent out to lunch and dinner. Brent
was learning to enjoy these long meals at hotel restaurants. He had suddenly
realized that

They were discussing Brent staying at Hero's home during winter break to watch
his dog, while Hero was travelling in Canada for a project. Hero needed someone
to watch his dog, and Brent needed a quiet place to finish his college
applications.

Brent took the long MRT ride to the edge of the city, and then walked up a road
bordered by tufted grass. It was drizzling.

It was refreshing to wake up in Hero's home. The winter sun warmed the wooden
floors of the guest bedroom, and Brent got out of bed with a sense of purpose
and well-being.

The only time when he went to the city was to go to the area around Taipei main
station to buy an external hard drive.

When it got dark, Brent tried to use some of Hero's fancy ingredients to make
dinner. The pasta ended up being too salty. The pot lay unwashed in the
soapstone sink until he realized that Helsa would happily lick it clean.

The days leading up to the new year passed quickly. It was almost 2010, the
beginning of his decade. In 2020 he'd be twenty-seven, his character would be
more or less set.

He watched educational films about important construction projects in Taiwan's
past, including the Xueshan tunnel project where twenty-five people died over
the course of fifteen years of construction.

At six PM on New Year's Eve Brent stopped working and messaged Emilio, an
exchange student from Mexico, to invite him to hang out at Hero's house. Brent
told him it'd be a good place to watch the fireworks, situated above the city,
and that he should invite the Brazilians.

Brent paced back and forth, waiting for a response. He was worried that just two
or three people would come and be disappointed. It was a long trip from the
hookah bars to Yangmingshan, and Brent was afraid that the Brazilians would
ather try to go to a club. Brent needed this to go well.

---

Around ten PM, a large group of exchange students arrived at the front door.
It was a much larger group than Brent had expected.

Brent brought out a bottle of yellowish liquor in which hornets were suspended,
while two Brazilian engineering students figured out the sound system.

Brent sat in a leather chair under a lamp with a long metal neck. He felt
accomplished, watching everyone talking and dancing happily. He could see
fireworks shooting off Taipei 101, tiny grains of light in the distance.

After midnight they ended up in a windowless room in the basement where the
floor was covered with Tatami mats and cushions, listening to reggaeton.  Brent
sat up against the wall talking with a girl from Columbia, watching Emilio and
Joshua give the two Brazilian girls back rubs. This went on for a long time. The
orgiastic intensity made Brent uncomfortable. He was reminded of teaching some
family friends how to masturbate back when he was eleven, across the inky
darkness of a room above a boathouse in Muskoka, Canada.

In the morning, Brent went into the laundry room to feed Helsa. The other
exchange students had left a few hours earlier, walking towards the MRT station
in the mist.

"Oh shit," he said, touching Helsa.

Helsa was dead.

Brent touched her cold, bony joints with morbid fascination.

He texted Hero. Brent barely understood how to use his flip phone, but Hero
repsonded almost immediately with an apology and an address, the address of
veternarian where Brent could bring Helsa's body for disposal.

What a situation, thought Brent.

---

A few hours later, Brent set off down Hero's driveway with a luxury duffel bag
containing Helsa's body knocking up against his thighs. He had wrapped up the
body in a garbage bag, worried that the dog's bowel's might leak.

It was only about a mile to the MRT station, but Brent realized it was going to
be a struggle.

He was starting to think about hitchhiking when a blue, three-wheeled truck
pulled over next to him.

"Where're you going?" the driver shouted out the window, showing a mouth of
reddened teeth.

"Songshan MRT station," said Brent.

"I'll take you!" said the driver.

Leaving the engine running, the driver got out and helped Brent lift the duffel
bag over the truck's tailgate.

"Pretty heavy! What's in it?"

"Gifts," said Brent, pushing a few items off of the passenger seat and sitting
down. He suddenly felt optimistic.

"I was visiting family," continued Brent, as the driver pulled back onto the
road.

"Impressive!" said the driver. "Are you Christian?"

"My family is Christian, myself, I'm not sure."

It felt good to be going fast. Brent was surprised by the smell of Christmas
trees, lying by the side of the road. They quickly arrived at the base of the
hills. Songshan station rose above the quiet commercial streets.

"We're here!" said the driver, pulling into the empty bus lane. He started to
roll a cigarette. Brent got out of the car, looking up to see if a train was
coming.

"One second," said the driver around the cigarette, and then quickly closed the
passenger door and stepped on the gas, the two-stroke engine whining.

Brent took a few quick steps, waving at the truck. He looked for a license plate
but there wasn't one.

The truck turned around the corner at the end of the block. Brent heard the
quiet rush of an approaching train overhead.
