# making the pulling down gesture to indicate fucking someone

The other exchange students didn't seem to appreciate P.P. Hero's large
collection of educational DVDs, displayed on shelves rising behind his living
room staircase. Brent made his way up the warm, carpeted steps, trying appear
thoughtful as he read the titles on the jewel cases: Megastructures, Man vs.
Wild, How It's Made. 

At the top of the stairs, Brent entered the kitchen, nodding politely at a group
of older Rotarians. They stood just aside from a fierce beam of sunlight,
smiling broadly at each other. 

Hero was washing a knife at the sink.

"You have so many DVDs," said Brent. "How do you say 'DVD' in Mandarin?"

Hero looked over at him and shrugged. "DVD," he said.

Hero studied the inside of the fridge, his expressive face indicating that he'd
forgotten what he was looking for.

"Ah, so," he said, selecting a taro root. He cut it up on the black counter and
swept the slices into his hand.

"I'll introduce you to my dog," said Hero.

Brent followed Hero into a dark laundry room adjacent to the kitchen.

"Here she is. Helsa."

A yellow lab wagged her tail quietly. Hero knelt down besides the dog's bed and
let her eat the taro out of his hand.

The tall blonde girl with the acne couldn't believe that Brent was a virgin.

"Why would I lie about that?" said Brent.

"Aw! Brent!" said the tall girl, scrambling up over a tuft of wet reeds, stone
and root, following the student ahead of her.

The group on a short hiking trip in the hills north of Taipei, somewhere near
Hero's house. They were inside a cloud: sections of the hiking trail appeared
before them one by one, sometimes interrupted by small pavilions where they
would rest. At the pavilions there was burning incense and basins of sulphur
water, which made Brent's face feel soft and clean, promising a future of new,
better skin.

"Your host mother asked me to meet with you," said Hero, a few weeks later.
Brent and Hero were eating at a French-themed restaurant on a quiet street south
of Zhongxiao East Road.

"There are issues with your lateness to school," said Hero. He lowered his head
and slurped his French Onion soup.

Brent explained that he was staying up late writing his college application
essays, that he was going to apply for a special scholarship. That's why he was
late.

"Still, your teachers and fellow students feel disrespected," said Hero.

"I'm sorry about that," said Brent.

Hero looked at Brent thoughtfully as the waiter poured a glass of wine.

"You are being very foolish, I think," said Hero finally. "Why are you here? In
Taiwan?"

Brent was suddenly very aware of his body, ashamed, staring at Hero's wine glass.

"I want to learn Mandarin," said Brent. He repeated himself clumsily in Mandarin.

"I'll help you," said Hero.

Every few weeks Brent had dinner with Hero and his wife, sometimes at a
restaurant in the city and sometimes at Hero's home.

Brent discovered that he could make these dinners very pleasant if he simply
asked questions and let Hero explain something he cared about. His wife mostly
smiled and stared at her hands.

She was an art teacher, and Brent started to bring her drawings to critique.  He
drew during class, drawing his teachers, who he almost completely failed to
understand, and the courtyard outside the classroom. Hero's wife loved to draw
from life. She showed Brent her drawing technique books, which were really scans
of older books from the 1950's, full of exercises meant for an aspiring
commercial artist. When Brent asked to borrow one of the books, she smiled and
led Brent to the living room, shooing Helsa from the couch and opening her
laptop.

She paused and called for Hero, using a nickname that Brent couldn't parse.

"Ah, she wants to show you how to use the bittorrent," said Hero, when he
appeared behind the couch.

Hero translated for his wife as she explained how to install a bittorrent
client and use an tracker to search for art books.

"You try!" said Hero, reaching over to pause an art book download. "Search!"

"Wait, I can pause the downloads whenever?" said Brent. He was stunned by the
download speed.

"Yes, yes."

Brent thought for a moment, and searched for "Modest Mouse". 

Dozens of albums and discographies appeared.

Early in December, Hero invited Brent to a health club on the top floor of the
Fuxing Sogo department store. Children were running around the lobby, holding
craft projects made of evergreen boughs and pasta.

The pool was surprisingly large and cold. After a short swim, Brent joined Hero
in the long, narrow steam room, empty except for two grey-haired men speaking
German.

Brent sat down next to Hero, who had a wet towel over his eyes.

"How do you feel about this building?" asked Hero.

"I feel it's strange," said Brent, in Mandarin. "I feel far away."

Hero used his face towel to wipe a circle on the tall window between them,
revealing the grey sky outside.

"I worked on this building in the early nineties."

"Wow."

Hero pointed out a sub-roof, still far above the narrow streets below.  "I
designed the horizontal beams over that gap, twelve stories high," said Hero,
switching to English. "They are wide enough to walk across."

"I see," said Brent.

---

Brent followed Hero out of the steam room. They entered a blue-tiled room of
baths, some cold and some hot.

Hero grabbed a pot of gritty soap and a sponge and pointed to a vaulted chamber.
He turned on a heavy flow of water with a faucet overhead.

"Here, I'll give you a scrub. Very good for your skin."

Brent stood, tense, under the lukewarm water as Hero scrubbed at his back and
neck.

Hero reached under Brent's swim trunks and grabbed his groin, his fingers
touching Brent's balls. Brent didn't move or say anything, thinking of pushing
Hero away, someone slipping. After about fifteen seconds Hero pulled his hand
out and gave Brent's legs a quick sponge.

"Now let's get in the cold water. Last step," said Hero.

Brent turned around and walked directly into the waist-deep pool, which was
shockingly cold. He sat down in it. There were a few other men.

Brent thought about cultural differences, wondering if he was interpreting the
moment correctly.

"Fresh water. Hard to find freshwater pool, with no chlorine," said Hero, in
English.

"After locker room, let's get hamburgers, okay?" continued Hero, in Mandarin
again.

"Sounds good," said Brent.

"You're learning a lot from Past President Hero," said Brent's host mother,
gesturing with a snail shell. "How to play go, how to be a gentleman." She
punched Hero's arm.

Hero and Brent's was learning to enjoy these long meals at hotel restaurants. He
just had to get into a certain mental state away from his anxieties, focused on
learning.

They were planning winter break. Brent was going to stay at Hero's house while
Hero was travelling in Canada for a project. Brent needed a quiet place to
finish his college applications, and Helsa needed company.

---

Brent took the long MRT ride to the edge of the city, and then walked up a road
bordered by tufted grass. It was drizzling.

It was refreshing to wake up in Hero's home. The winter sun warmed the wooden
floor of the guest bedroom, and Brent got out of bed with a sense of purpose and
well-being.

But it was still hard to write his essay.

When it got dark, Brent tried to use some of Hero's fancy ingredients to make
dinner. The pasta ended up being too salty. The pot lay unwashed in the
soapstone sink until he realized that Helsa would happily lick it clean.

---

The days leading up to the new year passed quickly. It was almost 2010, the
beginning of his decade. In 2020 he'd be twenty-seven, his character would be
more or less set.

He watched educational films about important construction projects in Taiwan's
past, including the Xueshan tunnel project where twenty-five people died over
the course of fifteen years of construction.

The only time he left was to go to the underground street by Taipei main station
to buy an external hard drive.

At six PM on New Year's Eve Brent stopped working and messaged Emilio, an
exchange student from Mexico, to invite him to hang out at Hero's house. Brent
told him it'd be a good place to watch the fireworks, situated above the city.

Brent paced back and forth, waiting for a response. He was worried that just two
or three people would come and be disappointed. It was a long trip to
Yangmingshan, and Brent was afraid that the Brazilians would rather try to go to
a club. Brent needed this to go well.

---

Around ten PM, a large group of exchange students arrived at the front door.
It was a much larger group than Brent had expected.

Brent brought out a bottle of yellowish liquor with hornets suspended in it,
while two Brazilian engineering students figured out the sound system.

When they got it working Brent felt a shiver down his spine. It was really good.

Emilio grabbed the bottle from Brent and pranced around the living room, pumping
his fist and draping his arms around two of the Columbian students who had
started dancing with each other.

Brent sat in a leather chair under a lamp with a long metal neck. He felt
accomplished, watching everyone talking and dancing happily. He could see
fireworks shooting off Taipei 101, tiny grains of light in the distance. The
tall blonde girl, (Alyssa, American), sat down next to Brent, and asked him a
bunch of questions about his relationship with Hero and his study methods. 

After midnight they went to a windowless room in the basement where the floor
was covered with Tatami mats and cushions, listening to reggaeton. Brent sat up
against the wall talking with a girl from Columbia, watching Emilio and Joshua
give the two Brazilian girls back rubs. This went on for a long time. The
orgiastic intensity made Brent uncomfortable. He was reminded of teaching some
family friends how to masturbate back when he was eleven, across the inky
darkness of a room above a boathouse.

In the morning, Brent went into the laundry room to feed Helsa. The other
exchange students had left a few hours earlier, walking towards the MRT station
in the mist.

"Oh shit," he said, touching Helsa.

Helsa was dead.

Brent touched her cold, bony joints with morbid fascination.

He texted Hero, struggling to use the burner phone Hero had given him. Hero
responded almost immediately with an apology and an address, the address of
vet where Brent could bring Helsa's body.

What a situation, thought Brent.

---

A few hours later, Brent set off down Hero's driveway with a luxury duffel bag
containing Helsa's body. He had wrapped up the body in a garbage bag, worried
that the dog's bowels might leak.

It was only about two miles to the MRT station, but Brent realized it was going
to be a struggle. The bag was heavy against his thighs.

He was starting to think about hitchhiking when a blue, three-wheeled truck
pulled over in front of him, honking unnecessarily.

"Where're you going?" the driver shouted out the window, showing a mouth of
reddened teeth.

"Songshan MRT station," said Brent.

"I'll take you!" said the driver.

Leaving the engine running, the driver got out and helped Brent lift the duffel
bag over the truck's tailgate.

"Pretty heavy! What's in it?"

"Gifts," said Brent. He opened the passenger side door, pushed a few items off
of the seat, and sat down. He suddenly felt optimistic.

"I was visiting family," continued Brent, as the driver pulled back onto the
road.

"Impressive!" said the driver.

It felt good to be going fast. Brent was surprised by the sight and smell of
Christmas trees, lying by the side of the road.

"Are you Christian?" asked the driver.

"My family is Christian, myself, I'm not sure."

They quickly arrived at the base of the hill. Songshan station rose above the
quiet commercial streets.

"We're here!" said the driver, pulling into the empty bus lane. He started to
roll a cigarette. Brent got out of the car, looking up to see if a train was
coming.

"One second," said the driver around the cigarette, and then quickly reached
over to close the passenger door and stepped on the gas. The two-stroke engine
whined as the truck accelerated.

Brent took a few quick steps, waving at the truck. He looked for a license plate
but there wasn't one.

The truck turned around the corner at the end of the block. Brent heard the
quiet rush of an approaching train overhead.
