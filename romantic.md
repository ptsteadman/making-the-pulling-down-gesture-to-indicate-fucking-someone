# making the pulling down gesture to indicate fucking someone

Early in December, P.P. Hero invited Brent to a health club on the top floor of
the Fuxing Sogo department store. Children were waiting impatiently in the
lobby, each with a craft project made from paper and evergreen boughs.

The pool was surprisingly large and cold. After a short swim, Brent joined Hero
in the long, narrow steam room, empty except for two grey-haired men speaking
German.

Brent sat down next to Hero. He had a wet towel over his eyes.

"How do you feel about this building?" asked Hero.

"I feel it's strange," said Brent, in Mandarin. "I feel far away from my home."

Hero removed the towel from his face and wiped a circle on the tall window
between them, revealing the overcast sky outside.

"I worked on this building in the early nineties."

"Wow."

Hero pointed out a sub-roof, far above the dense streets below. "I designed the
horizontal beams over that gap, twelve stories high," said Hero, switching to
English. "They are wide enough to walk across."

"I see," said Brent.

---

Brent followed Hero out of the steam room, his skin suddenly clammy. They
entered a blue-tiled room of baths, some cold and some hot.

Hero grabbed a pot of gritty soap and a sponge and pointed to a vaulted chamber.
He turned on a heavy flow of water with a faucet overhead.

"Here, I'll give you a scrub. Very good for your skin."

Brent stood, tense, under the lukewarm water as Hero scrubbed at his back and
neck.

Hero reached under Brent's swim trunks and grabbed his groin, his fingers
touching Brent's balls. Brent didn't move or say anything, thinking of pushing
Hero away, someone slipping. After about fifteen seconds Hero pulled his hand
out and gave Brent's legs a quick sponge.

"Now let's get in the cold water. Last step," said Hero.

Brent turned around and walked directly into the waist-deep pool, which was
shockingly cold. He sat down in it. There were a few other men.

Brent thought about cultural differences, wondering if he was interpreting the
moment correctly.

"Fresh water. Hard to find freshwater pool, with no chlorine," said Hero, in
English. Brent was always sort of annoyed when Hero used English.

"After getting dressed, let's get hamburgers, okay?" said Hero, in Mandarin
again.

"Sounds good," said Brent.

A few weeks later, Brent got lunch with his host mother and Hero at the Sheridan
hotel. Hero had invited Brent to stay at his home during winter break, while he
was travelling in Canada for a project. Hero needed someone to watch his dog,
and Brent needed a quiet place to finish his college application essays.

"You're learning a lot from Hero," said Brent's host mother, gesturing with a
snail shell. "How to play chess, how to be a gentleman." She punched Hero's arm.
They were old friends.

Back in September, Brent's host mother had arranged the initial meeting between
Hero and Brent. Brent was in trouble for often being late to school.

At first Brent was annoyed with Hero, as he slurped French Onion soup and
insisted that Brent must respect his teachers, regardless of his other
interests. Brent was annoyed because he had hoped that Hero would be different.
When Hero had spoken at the Rotary exchange student orientation, something about
to his mannerisms and appearance gave Brent chills, how he had looked like a
movie character with his designer glasses and shirt.

---

Brent took the long MRT ride to the edge of the city, and then walked up a road
bordered by tufted grass. It was drizzling.

It wasn't Brent's first time at Hero's home. In August, Hero had held a
reception for the exchange students, where they sat in small groups in his
living room, dipping squid, cabbage and tofu into portable hotpots. On that
night Hero's home was like a jewelry case, but cool and wet, smelling faintly of
sulphur from the dark stone underlying the hills of Yangmingshan.

Brent said hello to Hero and his wife, and then went to put his stuff in the
guest bedroom.

"You have so many DVDs," said Brent, when he found Hero in the kitchen. "How do
you say 'DVD' in Mandarin?"

Hero shrugged. "DVD," he said.

Brent had noticed all six seasons of "Megastructures" behind a glass case in his
room.

"How many have you watched?"

"Most," said Hero, opening his fridge. "I make time to relax and learn."

Hero studied the inside of the fridge, his expressive face clearly indicating
that he'd forgotten what he was looking for.

"Ah, so," he said, selecting a taro root. He cut it up on the jet black counter
and then swept the slices into his hand.

"I'll show you how to feed Helsa," said Hero.

Brent followed Hero into a dark room adjacent to the kitchen.

"Here she is."

A yellow lab wagged its tail quietly at Hero and Brent. Hero kneeled on a pillow
besides the dog's bed and let the dog eat the taro out of his hand.

---

Waking up in Hero's home was refreshing. The winter sun had warmed the wooden
floors of the guest bedroom, inviting Brent to get out of bed.

Brent ate breakfast sitting beneath one of the pieces of calligraphy that Hero
had helped him read and understand. The task of finishing his essays lay ahead
of him.

He procrastinated by sitting in the dark laundry room, petting Helsa.

When it got dark, Brent tried to use some of Hero's fancy ingredients to make
dinner. The pasta ended up being too salty. The pot lay unwashed in the
soapstone sink until he realized that Helsa would happily lick it clean.

---

The days leading up to the new year passed quickly. It was almost 2010, the
beginning of his decade. In 2020 he'd be twenty-seven, his character would be
more or less set.

He was almost done with the essays. He'd turn them in late but it'd be ok.

He watched documentaries about important construction projects in Taiwan's past,
including the tunnel project where x people died. He missed talking with Hero
about rooms and light.

---

At six PM on New Year's Eve Brent stopped working and messaged Emilio, an
exchange student from Mexico, to invite him to hang out at Hero's house. Brent
told him it'd be a good place to watch the fireworks, situated above the city,
and that he should invite the Brazilians.

Brent paced back and forth, waiting for a response.

---

Around ten PM, a large group of exchange students arrived at the front door.
It was a much larger group than Brent had expected.

Everyone was excited to have Hero's house for the night, and they congratulated
Alex.

"It's because your Mandarin is so good," said Emilio.

Liquor was set out in the living room. They tried a yellowish bottle in which
hornets were suspended, while two Brazilian engineering students figured out the
soundsystem. Once they got the music working, the girls started dancing.

Brent sat in a leather chair under a lamp with a long metal neck. He felt
accomplished, watching everyone talking and dancing happily. He could see
fireworks shooting off Taipei 101, tiny grains of light in the distance.

Finally he got up, and joined the dancing, forgetting himself like he had
learned at social nights in middle school.

After midnight they ended up in a windowless room in the basement where the
floor was covered with Tatami mats and cushions, listening to reggaeton.  Brent
sat up against the wall talking with a girl from Columbia, watching Emilio and
Joshua give the two Brazilian girls back rubs. This went on for a long time. The
orgiastic intensity, without any sex, made Alex uncomfortable. He was reminded
of teaching some family friends how to masturbate back when he was eleven,
across the inky darkness of a room above a boathouse in Muskoka, Canada.

---

In the morning, Brent went into the laundry room to feed Helsa, feeling hungover
and happy after watching the other exchange students walk down the road towards
the MRT station in the mist.

"Oh shit," he said.

Helsa was dead. Brent touched her bony joints with morbid fascination. Her
body was no longer warm.

He texted Hero that Helsa was dead. Brent barely understood how to use his phone,
it was on loan from another friend of his host mother's.

Hero responded almost immediately with an apology, and then an address, telling
him that it was a vet where Brent could bring the body.

What a situation, thought Brent.

---

A few hours later, Brent set off down Hero's driveway carrying a luxury duffel
bag containing Helsa's body. He had wrapped up the body in a garbage bag first,
worried about the possiblity of the dog's bowels leaking.

It was only about a mile to the MRT station, but Alex realized it was going to
be a struggle to make it there, with the bag knocking up against his thighs.

Brent was surprised by the scent of a Christmas tree, lying by the side of the
road.

He was starting to think about hitchhiking when a blue, three-wheeled truck
pulled over in front of him.

"Where're you going?" the driver shouted out of the window, showing a mouth of
reddened teeth.

"Songshan MRT station," said Brent.

"I'll take you!" said the driver.

Leaving the engine running, the driver got out and helped Brent lift the duffel
bag over the truck's tailgate.

"Pretty heavy! What's in it?"

"Gifts," said Brent, getting into the passenger seat. The cab of the truck was
full of discarded styrofoam packaging. Brent suddenly felt optimistic, like he'd
get his essays done easily.

"I was visiting family," continued Brent, as the driver rapidly pulled back onto
the road.

"Impressive!" said the driver. "Are you Christian?"

"My family is Christian, myself, I'm not sure."

They quickly arrived at Songshan station, nestled into the base of the mountain.

"We're here!" said the driver, pulling into the empty bus lane. He started to
roll a cigarette. Brent got out of the car, looking up at the tracks to see if a
train was coming.

"One second," said the driver around the cigarette, and then quickly closed the
passenger door and stepped on the gas, the two-stroke engine of the small truck
whining.

Just before the truck turned around the corner, Brent thought to look for a
license plate. There wasn't one.

For a moment Brent wondered if the driver had simply forgotten about the large
duffel bag in the back of his truck. He heard the quiet rush of an approaching
train overhead.
