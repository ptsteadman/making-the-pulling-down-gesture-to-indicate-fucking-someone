Early in December, P.P. Hero invited Alex to a health club on the top floor of the
Fuxing Sogo department store. Children were waiting impatiently in the lobby,
each with a Christmas craft made from evergreen boughs and pasta.

The pool was surprisingly large and cold. After a short swim, Alex went to the
long, narrow steam room, which was empty except for Hero and two grey-haired men
speaking in German.

Alex sat down next to Hero. He had a wet towel over his eyes.

"What do you feel about this building?" asked Hero.

"I feel it's strange," said Alex, in Mandarin. "I feel far away from my home."

Hero removed the towel and used it to wipe a circle on the tall window between
them, revealing the overcast sky outside.

"I worked on this building in the early nineties."

"Wow."

Hero pointed out a sub-roof, still far above the dense streets below. "I
designed the horizontal beams over that gap, twelve stories high," said Hero,
switching to English.  "They are wide enough to walk across. No one will ever
walk across, but people will imagine."

"I see," said Alex.

Alex followed Hero out of the steam room, his skin suddenly clammy.  They
entered a blue-tiled room of baths, some cold and some hot.

Hero grabbed a pot of gritty soap and a sponge and pointed to a vaulted chamber.
He turned on a heavy flow of water with a faucet overhead.

"Here, I'll give you a scrub. Very good for your skin."

Alex stood, tense, under the lukewarm water as Hero scrubbed at his back and
neck. This was just generally awkward.

Hero reached under Alex's swim trunks and grabbed his groin, his fingers
touching Alex's balls. Alex didn't move or say anything, thinking of pushing
Hero away, someone slipping. After about fifteen seconds Hero pulled his hand
from under Alex's swim trunks and gave his legs a quick sponge.

"Now let's get in the cold water. Last step," said Hero.

Alex turned around and walked directly into the waist-deep pool, which was
shockingly cold. He sat down in it. There were a few other men.

Alex thought about cultural differences, wondering if he was interpreting the moment
correctly.

"Fresh water. Hard to find freshwater pool, with no chlorine," said Hero, in
English.  Alex always got a bit annoyed when Hero used English.

"After getting dressed, let's get hamburgers, how about?" said Hero, in Mandarin
again.

"Absolutely," said Alex.

Hero invited Alex to stay at his home during winter break. Hero would be in
Canada for a project, and needed someone to watch his dog.

"You're learning a lot from Hero," said Alex's host mother. "How to play chess,
how to be a gentleman."

Hero was friends with Alex's host mother, an older, wealthy woman who lived in a
fashionable area of Taipei.

Alex needed a quiet place to work on his college application essays, and Hero's
isolated home in the sulphuric hills north of Taipei would be perfect.

Alex took the long MRT ride to the edge of the city, and then took a cab to Hero's
home.

It wasn't his first time visiting Hero's home. In August, Hero had held a
reception for the exchange students of the district.  In the living room, small
groups of exchange students sat in small groups around portable hotpots, dipping
squid, cabbage and tofu into the boiling red water.

Alex put his stuff in the large guest bedroom, and met Hero in the kitchen.

"You have so many DVDs," said Alex. "How do you say 'DVD' in Mandarin?"

Hero shrugged. "DVD," he said.

Alex had noticed all six seasons of "Megastructures" behind a glass case in his
living room.


"How many have you watched?"

"Most," said Hero, smiling and opening his fridge. "I make time to relax and
learn."

Hero studied the inside of the fridge, his expressive face clearly indicating
that he'd forgotten what he was looking for.

"Ah, so," he said, selecting a taro root. He cut it up on the jet black counter
and then swept the slices into his hand.

"I'll introduce you to my dog," said Hero.

Alex followed Hero into a dark room adjacent to the kitchen.

"Here she is."

A yellow lab wagged its tail quietly at Hero and Alex. Hero kneeled on a pillow
besides the dog's bed and let the dog eat the taro out of his hand.

"What's her name?"

"Daisy," said Hero.

Alex tried to use some of Hero's fancy ingredients. The pasta ended up being
too salty. The pot lay unwashed in the soapstone sink until he realized that
Daisy would happily lick it clean.

Alex often went to lunch with Hero and his host mother. Both were patient,
enthusiastic teachers of Mandarin.

During the first week of school, there was a cool girl with short hair and blue
eyes in Alex's class. He didn't really understand what was going on, but it was
obvious that she was trouble.

On his way home on Friday night, he ran into the girl with short hair. She was
standing with a group of friends, holding a white Yamaha racing bike with
glowing wheels.  Alex had never seen someone look so cool. He tried to talk to
her but she didn't really speak English, at all, unlike many of his other
classmates.
Hero often took Alex and his host mother out for lunch at hotels around

Alex didn't want to seem desperate, lonely in this beautiful house.

Alex sat in a leather chair under a lamp with a long metal neck. He felt
accomplished.

"P.P. Sunshine requested that I meet with you," said Hero.

"Yes, I understand," said Alex.

"There are issues with your lateness to school."

They were eating at a French-themed restaurant. Alex told Hero that his lateness
and other problems were caused by his college essays, and that it'd get better
once he finished.

"That doesn't change the fact that your teacher is disrespected," said Hero.

Hero slurped at his French onion soup. Alex felt annoyed with him. The first
time Alex heard Hero speak at the orientation event for the exchange students,
he knew Hero was special somehow. He'd felt shivers as Hero welcomed the
students to Taiwan, looking like a sort of movie character with his designer
glasses and suit.

"How do you say 'respect' in Mandarin?" asked Alex.
