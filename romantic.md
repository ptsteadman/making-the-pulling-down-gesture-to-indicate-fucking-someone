# Romantic

Alex spoke with P.P. Hero in the kitchen of his home.

"You have so many DVDs," said Alex. "How do you say 'DVD' in Mandarin?"

Hero shrugged. "DVD," he said.

Alex had noticed all six seasons of "Megastructures" behind a glass case in his
living room.

In the living room, small groups of exchange students sat in small groups around
portable hotpots, dipping squid, cabbage and tofu into the boiling red water.

"How many have you watched?"

"Most," said Hero, smiling and opening his fridge. "I make time to relax and
learn."

Hero studied the inside of the fridge, his expressive face clearly indicating
that he'd forgotten what he was looking for.

"Ah, so," he said, selecting a taro root. He cut it up on the jet black counter
and then swept the slices into his hand.

"I'll introduce you to my dog," said Hero.

Alex followed Hero into a dark room adjacent to the kitchen.

"Here she is."

A yellow lab wagged its tail quietly at Hero and Alex. Hero kneeled on a pillow
besides the dog's bed and let the dog eat the taro out of his hand.

"What's her name?"

"Daisy," said Hero.

After a period of silence, Alex excused himself and returned to the living room.
As soon as he entered, Emilio draped his arm over his shoulder.

"Let's do a picture," said Emilio, gesturing towards the windows overlooking
Taipei.

Alex found a spot among the students and prepared to smile.

Hero's home was like a jewelry case, but cool and wet, smelling slightly of
sulphur, from the dark stone underlying the hills of Yangmingshan.

Emilio took the picture. The group crowded around Emilio's camera.

"Oh no, another one, another one," said Emilio.  He turned to Alex.

"Your nose, it looks like a boner on your face."

During the first week of school, there was a cool girl with short hair and blue
eyes in Alex's class. He didn't really understand what was going on, but it was
obvious that she was trouble. Alex lived with a wealthy older woman in a
fashionable part of Taipei, and on Friday after class, he wandered around the
busy streets behind his home.

On his way back home, he ran into the girl with short hair. She was standing
with a group of friends, holding a white Yamaha racing bike with glowing wheels.
Alex had never seen someone look so cool. He tried to talk to her but she didn't
really speak English, at all, unlike many of his other classmates.


Alex lived with a wealthy older woman in a fashionable part of Taipei. OnHis
doting host mother was friends with P.P. Hero, and enjoyed going out for dinner
at lunches

"P.P. Sunshine requested that I meet with you," said Hero.

"Yes, I understand," said Alex.

"There are issues with your lateness to school."

They were eating at a French-themed restaurant. Alex told Hero that his lateness
and other problems were caused by his college essays, and that it'd get better
once he finished. Hero didn't seem moved.

"That doesn't change the fact that your teacher feel disrespected," said Hero.

Alex thought of how he felt when he woke up in class, his face stuck to the
desk.

Hero slurped at his French onion soup. Alex felt annoyed with him. The first
time Alex heard Hero speak at the orientation event for the exchange students,
he knew Hero was special somehow. He'd felt shivers as Hero welcomed the
students to Taiwan, looking like a sort of movie character with his designer
glasses and suit.

"How do you say 'respect' in Mandarin?" asked Alex.

Early in December, Hero invited Alex to a health club on the top floor of the
Fuxing Sogo department store. Children were waiting impatiently in the lobby,
each with a Christmas craft made from evergreen boughs and pasta.

The pool was surprisingly large and cold, and after a short swim Alex went to
the stream room. Hero was there, with a wet towel over his eyes.  Two
grey-haired men were speaking in German.

Alex sat down next to Hero.

"What do you feel about this building?" asked Hero.

"I feel it's strange," said Alex, in Mandarin. "I feel far away from my home."

Hero removed the towel from his eyes and used it to wipe a circle on the tall
window between them. Alex could now see the overcast sky outside.

"I worked on this building in the early nineties."

"Wow."

Hero pointed out to a sub-roof far below. "I designed the horizontal beams over
that gap, twelve stories high," said Hero, switching to English.  "They are wide
enough to walk across. No one will ever walk across, but people will imagine."

"I see," said Alex.

"Why did you study architecture?" asked Alex.

"Being an architect is romantic," said Hero after a moment.

Alex followed Hero out of the steam room, his skin suddenly clammy.  They
entered a blue-tiled room of baths, some cold and some hot.

Hero grabbed a pot of gritty soap and a sponge and pointed to a vaulted chamber.
He turned on a heavy flow of water with a faucet overhead.

"Here, I'll give you a scrub. Very good for your skin."

Alex stood, tense, under the lukewarm water as Hero scrubbed at his back and
neck. This was just generally awkward. Hero reached under Alex's swim trunks and
grabbed his groin, his fingers touching Alex's balls. Alex didn't move or say
anything, thinking of pushing Hero away, someone slipping. After about fifteen
seconds Hero pulled his hand from under Alex's swim trunks and gave his legs a
quick sponge.

"Now let's get in the cold water. Last step," said Hero.

Alex turned around and walked directly into the waist-deep pool, which was
shockingly cold. He sat down in it. There were a few other men.

Alex thought about cultural differences, wondering if he was interpreting the moment
correctly.

"Fresh water. Hard to find freshwater pool, with no chlorine," said Hero, in
English.  Alex always got a bit annoyed when Hero used English. Alex looked over
at Hero.

"After getting dressed, let's get hamburgers, how about?" said Hero, in Mandarin
now.

"Absolutely," said Alex.

He missed so much: late for the New Year's trip to South Taiwan. He had
wandered around Taipei train station for hours.


Alex didn't want to seem desperate, lonely in this beautiful house.

Alex tried to use some of the Ryan's fancy ingredients. The pasta ended up being
too salty. The pot lay unwashed in the soapstone sink until he realized that
Daisy would happily lick it clean.

Alex sat in a leather chair under a lamp with a long metal neck. He felt
accomplished.
