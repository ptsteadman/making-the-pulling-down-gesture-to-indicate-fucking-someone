# Making the Pulling Down Gesture to Indicate Fucking Someone

Early in December, P.P. Hero invited Alex to a health club on the top floor of
the Fuxing Sogo department store. Children were waiting impatiently in the
lobby, each holding a craft project made from paper and evergreen boughs.

The pool was surprisingly large and cold. After a short swim, Alex joined Hero
in the long, narrow steam room. It was empty except for two grey-haired men
speaking in German.

Alex sat down next to Hero, who had a wet towel over his eyes.

"What do you feel about this building?" asked Hero.

"I feel it's strange," said Alex, in Mandarin. "I feel far away from my home."

Hero removed the towel and used it to wipe a circle on the tall window between
them, revealing the overcast sky outside.

"I worked on this building in the early nineties."

"Wow."

Hero pointed out a sub-roof, far above the dense streets below. "I designed the
horizontal beams over that gap, twelve stories high," said Hero, switching to
English. "They are wide enough to walk across. No one will ever walk across,
but people will imagine."

"I see," said Alex.

Alex followed Hero out of the steam room, his skin suddenly clammy. They entered
a blue-tiled room of baths, some cold and some hot.

Hero grabbed a pot of gritty soap and a sponge and pointed to a vaulted chamber.
He turned on a heavy flow of water with a faucet overhead.

"Here, I'll give you a scrub. Very good for your skin."

Alex stood, tense, under the lukewarm water as Hero scrubbed at his back and
neck.

Hero reached under Alex's swim trunks and grabbed his groin, his fingers
touching Alex's balls. Alex didn't move or say anything, thinking of pushing
Hero away, someone slipping. After about fifteen seconds Hero pulled his hand
out and gave Alex's legs a quick sponge.

"Now let's get in the cold water. Last step," said Hero.

Alex turned around and walked directly into the waist-deep pool, which was
shockingly cold. He sat down in it. There were a few other men.

Alex thought about cultural differences, wondering if he was interpreting the moment
correctly.

"Fresh water. Hard to find freshwater pool, with no chlorine," said Hero, in
English.  Alex always got a bit annoyed when Hero used English.

"After getting dressed, let's get hamburgers, okay?" said Hero, in Mandarin
again.

"Absolutely," said Alex.

Over lunch at the Sheridan hotel, Hero invited Alex to stay at his home during
winter break. He was going to Canada for a project, and needed someone to watch
his dog.

"You're learning a lot from Hero," said Alex's host mother, gesturing with an
empty snail shell. "How to play chess, how to be a gentleman." She punched
Hero's arm. They were old friends.

Alex lived with his host mother in a wealthy, distracting area of Taipei.  He
needed a quiet place to work on his college application essays, and Hero's
isolated home in the sulphuric hills north of Taipei would be perfect.

---

Alex took the long MRT ride to the edge of the city, and then a cab.

It wasn't Alex's first time at Hero's home. In August, Hero had held a reception
for the Rotary exchange students, where they sat in small groups in his living
room, dipping squid, cabbage and tofu into portable hotpots.

Alex said hello to Hero and his wife, and then went to put his stuff in the
guest bedroom. He had stayed there before, after going out to dinner with Hero
and his mother, often at hotels, for dinners that lasted hours because Hero and
his host mother were patient teachers of Mandarin and loved to see movies after.

Alex put his stuff in the large guest bedroom, and met Hero in the kitchen.

"You have so many DVDs," said Alex. "How do you say 'DVD' in Mandarin?"

Hero shrugged. "DVD," he said.

Alex had noticed all six seasons of "Megastructures" behind a glass case in his
room.

"How many have you watched?"

"Most," said Hero, smiling and opening his fridge. "I make time to relax and
learn."

Hero studied the inside of the fridge, his expressive face clearly indicating
that he'd forgotten what he was looking for.

"Ah, so," he said, selecting a taro root. He cut it up on the jet black counter
and then swept the slices into his hand.

"I'll introduce you to my dog again," said Hero.

Alex followed Hero into a dark room adjacent to the kitchen.

"Here she is."

A yellow lab wagged its tail quietly at Hero and Alex. Hero kneeled on a pillow
besides the dog's bed and let the dog eat the taro out of his hand.

"What's her name?"

"Daisy," said Hero.

---

Waking up in Hero's home was a refreshing, almost magical experience. The winter
sun had warmed the wooden floors of the guest bedroom, inviting Alex to get out
of bed.

Alex tried to use some of Hero's fancy ingredients. The pasta ended up being
too salty. The pot lay unwashed in the soapstone sink until he realized that
Daisy would happily lick it clean.

Alex often went to lunch with Hero and his host mother. Both were patient,
enthusiastic teachers of Mandarin.

During the first week of school, there was a cool girl with short hair and blue
eyes in Alex's class. He didn't really understand what was going on, but it was
obvious that she was trouble.

On his way home on Friday night, he ran into her. She was standing with a group
of friends, holding a white Yamaha racing bike with glowing wheels.  Alex had
never seen someone look so cool. He tried to talk to her but she didn't really
speak English, at all, unlike many of his other classmates.

---

Caring about rooms and light, or having conversations about his interests.

"There are issues with your lateness to school."

They were eating at a French-themed restaurant. Alex told Hero that his lateness
and other problems were caused by his college essays.

"That doesn't change the fact that your teacher is disrespected," said Hero.

Hero slurped at his French onion soup. Alex felt annoyed with him. The first
time Alex heard Hero speak at the orientation event for the exchange students,
he knew Hero was special somehow. He'd felt shivers as Hero welcomed the
students to Taiwan, looking like a sort of movie character with his designer
glasses and suit.

"How do you say 'respect' in Mandarin?" asked Alex.

What is the character of "Alex"?

---

Alex sat in a leather chair under a lamp with a long metal neck. He felt
accomplished.

It was his decade. In 2020 he'd be 27. His character would be more or less set.
He had ten years to become something and it was starting.

Alex could see fireworks shooting off Taipei 101, tiny grains of light at the
distance.

The last person, Emilio, didn't leave until almost 4:30. Alex fell asleep on the
couch.

---

In the morning, Alex went into the laundry room to feed Daisy, hungover and
happy. Daisy was dead. Alex touched her bony joints with morbid fascination. Her
body was no longer warm.

He texted Hero that Daisy was dead. Alex barely understood how to use his phone,
it was on loan from another friend of his host mother's.

Hero responded almost immediately with an apology. Alex wrote that Daisy was
very peaceful.

Hero sent Alex an address, telling him that it was a vet that Alex could bring
the body to.

What a situation, thought Alex. He sent Paula an email.

---

A few hours later, Alex set off down Hero's driveway carrying a luxury duffel
bag containing Daisy's body. He had wrapped up the body in a garbage bag first,
worried about the possiblity of the dog's bowels leaking.

It was only about a mile to the MRT station. The feeling of the bag knocking up
against Alex's thighs was still unpleasant.

It was New Year's Day. Alex was surprised by the scent of a Christmas tree,
lying by the side of the road. It made him appreciate America.

He was starting to think about hitchhiking when a blue, three-wheeled truck
pulled over in front of him.

"Where're you going?" the driver shouted out of the window, showing a mouth of
reddened teeth.

"Songshan MRT station," said Alex.

"I'll take you!" said the driver.

Leaving the engine running, the driver got out and helped Alex lift the duffel
bag over the truck's tailgate.

"Pretty heavy! What's in it?"

"Gifts," said Alex, getting into the passenger seat. The cab of the truck was
full of discarded styrofoam packaging. Alex suddenly felt optimistic.

"I was visiting family," continued Alex, as the driver pulled back onto the road
rapidly.

"Impressive!" said the driver. "Are you Christian?"

"My family is Christian, myself, I'm not sure."

They quickly arrived at Songshan station, nestled into the base of the mountain.

"We're here!" said the driver, pulling into the empty bus lane. He started to
roll a cigarette. Alex got out of the car, looking up at the tracks to see if a
train was coming.

"One second," said the driver around the cigarette, and then quickly closed the
passenger door and stepped on the gas, the two-stroke engine of the small truck
whining.

Just before the truck turned around the corner, Alex thought to look for a
license plate. There wasn't one. For a moment Alex wondered if the driver had
simply forgotten about the large duffel bag in the back of his truck.
